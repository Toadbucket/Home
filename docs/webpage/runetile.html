<p>Craft Stories, Join the Rebellion, Support the Archive.</p>

<h2 id="wha-is-runetile">What Is Runetile?</h2>
<p>Runetile is a modular spell‑building system. Players place tiles, generate seeds, and watch their creations come alive with mechanics and flavor. Every spell is both a story and a tool—an artifact of the Archive.</p>
<p>now I’m releasing the system to the public to seek feedback for improvements I can work on.</p>
<h1>How It Works</h1>

<p>The core of Runetile is a set of tiles representing different spell components. Players arrange these tiles to create unique spells, each with its own mechanics and narrative flavor. The system encourages creativity and strategic thinking, allowing players to tailor their spells to their characters and playstyles.</p>
<p>Runetile is designed to be flexible and adaptable, making it suitable for a wide range of tabletop RPG settings and genres. Whether you're casting fireballs in a fantasy world or hacking systems in a cyberpunk future, Runetile provides the tools to bring your spellcasting visions to life.</p>
<p><b>Place Tiles:</b> Drag and arrange tiles on the board to form unique patterns.<br>

<b>Generate Seeds:</b> Each arrangement creates a seed—a code that preserves your spell.<br>

<b>Validate Spells:</b> The Archive’s validator reveals both mechanics (gameplay effects) and flavor (narrative immersion).<br>

<b>Share & Remix:</b> Seeds can be saved, shared, and remixed by other players.</p>

<h1>Runetile Categories</h1>

<b>Player Creativity:</b> The system thrives on experimentation. There are no wrong spells, only new discoveries.<br>

<b>Community Feedback:</b> Share seeds, suggest mechanics, and help shape the Archive’s future.</P>
