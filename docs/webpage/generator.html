<h1>Runetile, The TTRPG Spell Building System</h1>
<h1 id="homepage">Homepage</h1>
<div class="page-section">
<p>Greetings Traveler welcome to my Goblin Den I am your Goblin Ben and this is where you will uncover the truth of Runetile the open source spell building system. on this site will be posting about the Leatherbound universe that the system resides in as well as the Toadbucket’s Trinkets story progress and my handmade fantasy jewelry collections.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-about-me">Runetile system:</h2>
<p>Runetile is a modular spell building system designed for TTRPG, Tactile Solo Puzzles, Sandbox creative expression, and Competitive PVP.</p>
<p>Gameplay and rules:</p>
<p>Select a Tile, you can pick the tile or roll a six sided die to simulate a bag of random tiles.</p>
<p>Place the tile on the board, you can play that tile as a cantrip as it has inherent polarity imbalance.</p>
<p>continue placing individual tiles around the board to build multiple spells concurrently.</p>
<p>Rotate the tiles to face arrow side towards each other with a space between (use placeholder 0 tile to keep spacing if needed ! attention ! Do Not add 0 Tile seed string in validator).</p>
<p>two tiles together form a tome, a tome may be used as a component by having odd and even polarity in the group however to make a tome cantrip-able you must have two of the same polarity (odd/odd even/even).</p>
<p>On a Tome Group to the side of the empty space facing inwards add a third Tile to form a Rune this rune must have one opposing and two matching polarities. Runes are inherently Cantrip-able.</p>
<p>On a Rune Group the same as the Rune formation add a fourth Tile this forms a Glyph glyphs need to have 3/4ths polarity to be valid for cantrips however 50/50 is usable as a component.</p>
<p>Tomes Runes and Glyphs even as components can be capped with Tiles at loose connection points as long as the polarity is valid (more of one polarity than the other) then the components or cantrips become a spell form this is just a single group capped at all segments to be valid.</p>
<p>Tomes Runes and Glyphs are connected to each other at open connection points the formation gets capped at all loose connection points and if polarity is valid form a spell script.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-projects">Spell Cantrips, Spell Forms, and Spell Scripts once formed generate a Spell Seed.</h2>
<p>Here are several pieces I have designed and hand fabricated.</p>
<p>the Spell seed is sent to the interpreter (or worked out manually using a cypher) to first validate the polarity then generate the spell card.</p>
<p>the Runetile Tile Tome Rune and Glyph system is designed to be interchanged with any form of medium or art just track an id to a concept or design or sound or movement, create art or performances based on the tracked ids through repetition in the piece. </p>
<p>the Runetile Interpreter system is designed to be modular and incorporate the mechanics defined or is supported by the system you are playing, since the spell seed is being interpreted you can provide a distinct output for each id in each rank for the playstyle you want it can be PVP TTRPG VRPG or just messing around with what you can create with this system in your own sandbox environment.</p>
<p>Developers Note This is an art project and the programs are all MVP additionally I produced the applications and framework of my code using AI but the systems and the IP are all my original work.</p>
<p>This system is designed for the LeatherBound RPG system and Toadbucket's Trinckets narrative IP.</p>
